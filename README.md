# dbex
database explorer plugin for atom ide

## TODO
- controls on connection node
- remove connection
- edit connection
- identify structure loaded on connection and show actions
- show actions on each item
- make item actions call to engine
- execute query on engine
- identify engine response for: result set, more items on tree, or data query
- show result area when response is result set
- update node when result itemTree
- show query area with data when result is data query
- create connection action for refresh
- execute text from query area on engine
- tabbed query area + result area
- execute query from selected text (opened file or query area)
- option to copy data from result
- export result as csv
- generate log from all queries
- save/favorite query data tab
- select opened databases from statusbar, so selected query with hotkey can automatically run based on that

## Would be nice
- autocomplete on query area
- custom plugins for query area (ex.: action buttons)
- custom plugins for result area (ex.: exporter)
