# dbex
database explorer plugin for atom ide

## TODO
- clone datamodel folder into engine plugin (so files are always synced with core)
- remove connection
- edit connection
- create connection action for refresh
- execute query on engine
- show query area with data when result is data query
- execute text from query area on engine
- (tabbed query area) + (result area --done)
- execute query from selected text (opened file or query area)
- export result as csv
- generate log from all queries
- save/favorite query data tab
- select opened databases from statusbar, so selected query with hotkey can automatically run based on that

## Would be nice
- autocomplete on query area
- custom plugins for query area (ex.: action buttons)
- custom plugins for result area (ex.: exporter)
- engine plugins automatically install dbex core
